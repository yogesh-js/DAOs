# DAOs

This is a blockchain project. A DAO, or “Decentralized Autonomous Organization,” is a community-led entity with no central authority.
It is fully autonomous and transparent: smart contracts lay the foundational rules, execute the agreed upon decisions, and at any point,
proposals, voting, and even the very code itself can be publicly audited.

Ultimately, a DAO is governed entirely by its individual members who collectively make critical decisions about the future of the project, 
such as technical upgrades and treasury allocations.
